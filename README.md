# My Nixos Config

This is my nixos config! It lives in `/etc/nixos` on all of my personal machines. Additionally, it has:
- `scripts` - some useful scripts i have that are always in the path
- `dotfiles` - all of my dotfiles, organized with [dotcopy](https://dotcopy.firesquid.co)

I do not use this for servers. It is primarily for desktop use on personal machines.
