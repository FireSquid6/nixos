The difference between a bad programmer and a 
good one is whether he considers his code or his 
data structures more important. Bad programmers 
worry about the code. Good programmers worry about 
data structures and their relationships. 
-- Linus Torvalds

Clarity and brevity sometimes are at odds. 
When they are, I choose clarity. 
-- Jacob Kaplan-Moss

The competent programmer is fully aware of 
the limited size of his own skull. He therefore 
approaches his task with full humility, 
and avoids clever tricks like the plague. 
-- Edsger Dijkstra

Optimism is an occupational hazard of 
programming; feedback is the treatment. 
-- Kent Beck
~~~
Make it work, make it right, make it fast. 
-- Kent Beck

Any fool can write code that a computer 
can understand. Good programmers write 
code that humans can understand. 
-- Martin Fowler

A lot of times, people don't know what 
they want until you show it to them. 
-- Steve Jobs
~~~
Innovation is not about saying yes to 
everything. It's about saying NO to 
all but the most crucial features. 
-- Steve Jobs
~~~
Controlling complexity is the essence 
of computer programming. 
-- Brian Kernigan
~~~
Always code as if the guy who ends up 
maintaining your code will be a violent 
psychopath who knows where you live.
-- Martin Golding

Nine people can't make a baby in a month.
-- Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month
~~~
A clever person solves a problem. A wise 
person avoids it.
-- Albert Einstein
~~~
A language that doesn't affect the way you 
think about programming is not worth knowing. 
-- Alan J. Perlis
~~~
Don't gloss over a routine or piece of code 
involved in the bug because you "know" it 
works. Prove it. Prove it in this context, 
with this data, with these boundary conditions.
-- Andrew Hunt

If you ever talk to a great programmer, you'll 
find they know their tools like an artist knows 
their paintbrushes.
-- Bill Gates
~~~
The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the 
first 90 percent of the development time. The 
remaining 10 percent of the code account for the 
other 90 percent of the development time.
-- Tom Cargill

If you say "I told you so", you are the one who has 
failed. Because you knew, but did not manage to stop 
the train wreck.
-- Robert C. Martin
~~~
We crave for new sensations but soon become indifferent 
to them. Wonders of yesterday are today common occurrences.
-- Nikola Tesla
~~~
Every great developer you know got there by solving problems 
they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it.
-- Eric Ries
~~~
A program is like a poem: you cannot write a poem without writing it.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
~~~
The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity, 
of mastering multitude and avoiding its bastard chaos as 
effectively as possible.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
~~~
If you're actually doing TDD, you're throwing away tests all 
the time, as your understanding of what the code is changes.
-- Kerri Miller

The question of whether Machines Can Think... is about as 
relevant as the question of whether Submarines Can Swim.
-- Edsger Dijkstra
